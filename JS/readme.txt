JavaScript concepts required for backend

Callbacks
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, and executed after a task completes

Problems with Callbacks
❌ Callback Hell (nested callbacks)
❌ Hard to read and maintain
❌ Error handling becomes painful

Promises
A Promise represents a value that will be available now, later, or never

It has 3 states:
pending
fulfilled
rejected
